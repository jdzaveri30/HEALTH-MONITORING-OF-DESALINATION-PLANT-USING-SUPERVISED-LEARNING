# HEALTH-MONITORING-OF-DESALINATION-PLANT-USING-SUPERVISED-LEARNING
Early detection of membrane fouling using ML


The saltwater from the ocean constitutes 96.5% of the total water available in the planet.  The remaining 3.5 % are fresh water which is a paramount resource for the living organisms. Increasing population and climate change related activities demands researchers to expedite new methods to maximize the fresh water resources. Solar desalination is an environment-benign method that has the potential to fulfill the fresh water requirement for the planet. However, the efficiency of the desalination cells is limited by the fouling phenomenon. Since the pores of the membrane are blocked by the fouling, the desalting process yield low efficiency. Therefore, detecting and diagnosing the fouling phenomena using mathematical models are needed. Herein, we propose a machine learning modelling framework comprising  Support Vector Machine, K Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Networks based algorithms to monitor the onset of the fouling in the desalination cell individually. The permeate datapoints from the filtration process are collected using a lab on a chip device from the plant. They are used to validate all four models. Furthermore, model response on the permeate data points has been used as an indicator/soft sensor to grade the fouling level and potability of the treated water. The modelling framework   can be used in detecting the onset of fouling and erosion in the desalination cell with high precision.
